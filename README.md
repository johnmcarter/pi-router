# Flask Web Server for Raspberry Pi Router

To install the required dependencies, run
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
The web server is running continuously as a Linux service, so the webserver can be found at 127.0.0.1:8080 on a local browser while connected to the local Pi network.
